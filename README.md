# NOX-Macros
Lords Mobile Automation Macros for use with VOX Player
Created with NOX version 6.2.1.1

Arm Research "Quick Swap" Template

This NOX macro is designed to provide an example of a "Quick Swap" macro that switches your hero's armor. Since everyone has a different armor setup, you will need to design your own "Quick Swap" macro to fit your needs.  Creating a "Quick Swap" macro is very simple. Just open the VOX macro recorder, hit the record button (which looks like a play button), perform the needed clicks, stop the recording and your are done. Having at least one regular game Quick Swap helps, as this will be the default from which other setups can be created. If you don't haven't unlocked Quick Swaps yet, you can still create your own. You will just need to setup a default armor configuration. For example, setup your favorite attack armor, then start recording a new macro for resource gathering. Then from resource gathering create one back to the original attack config. Now you can go back an forth and create new ones like "attack to research armor".

Auto Shelter v1.0

Keep your leader and troops sheltered.

There is a short period of time will you will not be sheltered while the macro unshelters and reshelters: only a second or two.
