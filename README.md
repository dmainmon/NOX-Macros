# NOX-Macros
Lords Mobile Automation Macros for use with NOX Player
Created with NOX version 6.2.1.1

Arm Research "Quick Swap" Template

This NOX macro is designed to provide an example of a "Quick Swap" macro that switches your hero's armor. Since everyone has a different armor setup, you will need to design your own "Quick Swap" macro to fit your needs.  Creating a "Quick Swap" macro is very simple. Just open the NOX macro recorder, hit the record button (which looks like a play button), perform the needed clicks, stop the recording and your are done. Having at least one regular game Quick Swap helps, as this will be the default from which other setups can be created. If you don't haven't unlocked Quick Swaps yet, you can still create your own. You will just need to setup a default armor configuration. For example, setup your favorite attack armor, then start recording a new macro for resource gathering. Then from resource gathering create one back to the original attack config. Now you can go back an forth and create new ones like "attack to research armor".

Auto Collect 1

This macro will collect the bouncy Mystery Box, Send Helps, and collect VIP quests every 500 seconds. The 500 second sampling rate can be adjusted in the macro options. I like to run this macro at night while sleeping when I normally wouldn't be able to perform those tasks.

Auto Shelter v1.0

Keep your leader and troops sheltered.
This macro script is designed to work with the NOX Player and Lords Mobile. Lords Mobile must be open on the Turf view for this macro.  Shelter your troops then play the macro. It will re-shelter the troops every hour. At first the screen will move around to "calibrate" position. Then the screen will move to the shelter and perform the task. There is a short period of time will you will not be sheltered while the macro unshelters and reshelters: only a second or two.

Collect Guild Gifts v1.0

NOX Macro for LordsMobile.  This macro will allow you to collect all your guild gifts with the push of a couple buttons. 
You must first be on the "Guild Gifts" page. 
Then play the macro. It will begin collecting your guild gifts. 
When finished, click the pause button to stop the macro.
